## About Me

**I currently work** as the Data Scientist at [Shell](https://www.shell.us/about-us/projects-and-locations/shell-technology-center-houston.html). 

**Prior to joining Shell**, I worked as the [Senior Prognostics and Health Management Engineer](https://www.rit.edu/directory/czdgis-chuanzhi-dong) in [Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS)](https://www.rit.edu/sustainabilityinstitute/), at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/), Rochester, New York. I also worked as the Structural & Analytics Engineer in the Internet of Things (IoT) Tower, at [Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.parc.com/) (Xerox PARC), and the Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I received my PhD degree from UCF and I was advised by Professor [F. Necati Catbas](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/catbas/) in the [Laboratory for Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resilience and Safety (CITRS)](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/CITRS/) at UCF. 

- **In my position at RIT**, developed machine learning algorithms for condition-based maintenance plus (CBM+) projects such as prognostics and health management (PHM) of engine and transmission systems. I also developed the computer vision systems for automatic garment and textile applications by using image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, and also for the condition assessment of microstructures such as micro circuit boards. 

- **In my position at PARC**, I am conducting research on comprehensive structural assessment for transportation infrastructures such as bridges by utilizing fiber optic sensing, machine learning, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) technology and structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. 

- **During my Ph.D. research**, I developed a full version of computer vision-based structural monitoring and evaluation framework which combines the input-output information from images (loads and responses) to assess the performance and condition of structures. In my **postdoctoral research**, I continued to work at the same university, where I devoted myself to computer vision-based multi-level structural assessment at local and global level, structual condition assessment using dynamic testing, reliability evaluation, asset maintenance and management with artificial intelligence.  

**My research interests** are System Performance Diagnostics, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Computer Vision, Structural Dynamics, Non-destructive Evaluation, Vibration Serviceability, Intelligent Infrastructure, FEM, Smart Sensing, Bridge Load Rating, Artificial Intelligence, Smart Cities, Structural Reliability, Sustainability, Repair & Rehabilitation of Structures.

**My goal** is to develop effective and efficient technologies to support decision-making for owners to do better asset management and maintenance.

## Goals for the Near Future

* Investigating advanced technologies and theories to better support the safety, efficiency and reliability of our infrastructures and improve people's life.
* Converting the research findings into really useful products or tools for the researchers or engineering practioners in the area of infrastructure system monitoring and condition assessment. 

## Lifetime Goals

* Be a professor and teach some helpful courses
* Write a novel
* Maybe have PhD in History

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Create content & metadata
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
