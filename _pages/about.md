##About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candiate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Enginnering at the University of Michigan; meanwhile, I am also pursuing a M.S.E degree in Computer Science & Engineering. I am advised by Professor [Jerome P. Lynch](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jerlynch/proflynch.html) and am a graduate student research assistant in the [Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Technologies (LIST)](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jerlynch/index.html) at the University of Michigan. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of traditional infrastructures (e.g. highway bridges) and cutting-edge electrical & computer engineering technologies (e.g. computer vision). One of my recent research projects is to build a cyber-physical system (CPS) integrating wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) systems deployed in highway bridges with intelliegnt transportation systems (ITS) and cloud computing platforms aiming to make the infrastructure & transportation systems smarter and robuster.

I also intern at [Toyota Research Institute (TRI)](http://www.tri.global/), Ann Arbor, MI this semester (from Sep. 2017 to Dec. 2017). Working in the Materials Research Department, my responsibilty is to fulfill the requirement of materials informatics research in Toyota Research Institute of North America. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze problems in materials science. Typical duties include: text mining data from literatures and patents; clarify the connection between different objects; statistically analyze the property-structure-process relation, etc. 

A side quest of mine for this semester is to complete the [deep learning courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offered by Andrew Ng on Coursera. Check it out if you are interested. Welcome to discuss!

##Goals for the Near Future

1.Seeking for an internship opportunity related to software engineering or data analysis (machine learning) for Summer 2018.
2.Obtain my Ph.D. degree in two years and find an industry job related to tech product development that is not just fancy but can truly influence people's daily life. 

##Lifetime Goals
1.Run a fusion cuisine restaurant
2.Film a movide
3.Own a television channel or network

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Create content & metadata
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
