## About Me

* **Currently**, I serve as a dedicated **Data Scientist** within the Industrial AI group at [**Shell**](https://www.shell.us/about-us/projects-and-locations/shell-technology-center-houston.html). My expertise is centered on extracting crucial information from unstructured data, utilizing **natural language processing** (NLP) and **large language models** (LLM) to enhance **decision-making** processes in asset management, supply chain optimization, and tender processing. This includes a strategic emphasis on **minimizing deferment**, ensuring that operational efficiencies are maximized and delays are significantly reduced. In addition, I am involved in developing advanced solutions for diagnostics, prognostics, and **predictive maintenance** of industrial systems, employing state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning, time series analysis, and computer vision. My work is driven by a strong conviction in the transformative power of data and a commitment to leveraging this potential to revolutionize how industries manage and maintain their assets. By focusing on efficiency and innovation, I aim to contribute to the creation of more resilient and agile operational frameworks that can better withstand the challenges of modern industry.

* **Simultaneously**, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in **Computer Science** at the [**University of Texas at Austin**](https://www.utexas.edu/). This academic endeavor serves to deepen my understanding and enhance my expertise in this ever-evolving field. In addition, I've had the privilege of serving as a Learning Facilitator in the Department of Computer Science, bolstering teaching efforts for the Advanced Linear Algebra for Computing/Numerical Analysis course, with a special emphasis on high-performance computing.

* **Before joining Shell**, I was a **Senior Prognostics and Health Management Engineer** at the [Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS)](https://www.rit.edu/sustainabilityinstitute/), part of the [**Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)**](https://www.rit.edu/) in Rochester, New York. My role at RIT encompassed crafting advanced machine learning algorithms for condition-based maintenance, especially focusing on engine and transmission systems. I also played an instrumental role in developing computer vision systems for recycling and resource recovery, leveraging image analytics techniques. My proficiency also covered the assessment of intricate microstructures, including micro circuit boards.

* **Before RIT**, I made contributions as a **Structural & Analytics Engineer** at the Internet of Things (IoT) Tower within [Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.parc.com/) (Xerox PARC. Now PARC has become part of [SRI](https://www.sri.com/): Future Concepts Division). At **Xerox PARC**, my focus was on holistic structural assessments for transportation infrastructures, particularly bridges. I integrated advanced technologies like fiber optic sensing, machine learning, IoT devices, and structural health monitoring to optimize the resilience and safety of these vital structures.

* **On the academic front**, I embarked on a **Ph.D. in Structural Engineering** journey at the [**University of Central Florida**](https://www.ucf.edu/) (UCF). Under the esteemed guidance of Professor [F. Necati Catbas](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/catbas/) in the [Laboratory for Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resilience and Safety (CITRS)](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/CITRS/), my doctoral research led to a comprehensive **computer vision-based structural health monitoring and evaluation** framework. This innovative approach melded the input-output information of structural systems from images/videos (loads and responses) to gauge the health and performance of civil infrastructures. Post-Ph.D., I furthered my research at UCF as a **Postdoctoral Scholar**, exploring cutting-edge topics in multi-level structural assessment and AI-driven asset management.

* As a researcher, **my interests** are diverse, covering System Performance Diagnostics, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), Predictive Maintenance, Structural Health Monitoring, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, NLP, Structural Dynamics, and much more.

**In essence**, my goal is to harness my vast expertise and drive innovations that equip asset owners with powerful tools for informed decision-making, optimizing management and maintenance strategies.


## Near-Future Goals

* Explore cutting-edge technologies and theories to enhance the safety, efficiency, and reliability of our infrastructures, ultimately aiming to improve quality of life.
* Translate research discoveries into practical tools and products that can benefit researchers and practitioners in infrastructure monitoring and condition assessment.

## Lifetime Aspirations

* Become a professor and impart valuable courses to inspire the next generation.
* Author a novel that resonates with readers.
* Possibly pursue a Ph.D. in History, delving deep into the annals of our past.

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Create content & metadata
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
