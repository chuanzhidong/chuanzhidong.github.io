## About Me

* **Currently** I am a dedicated **Data Scientist** working within the **Industrial AI** group at [Shell](https://www.shell.us/about-us/projects-and-locations/shell-technology-center-houston.html). My primary focus lies in industrial system performance diagnostics, prognostics, and predictive maintenance. With a passion for harnessing data-driven solutions, I aim to revolutionize the way industries manage and maintain their assets effectively and efficiently.

* **In parallel** with my professional career, I am pursuing my Master's degree in **Computer Science** at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), further expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in this dynamic field.

* **Before joining Shell**, I held the position of **Senior Prognostics and Health Management Engineer** at the [Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS)](https://www.rit.edu/sustainabilityinstitute/), located at the [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/) in Rochester, New York. My work at RIT involved developing advanced machine learning algorithms for condition-based maintenance projects, particularly in the field of prognostics and health management of engine and transmission systems. Additionally, I played a crucial role in creating computer vision systems for automatic recycling and resource recovery applications, leveraging image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. My expertise also extended to the condition assessment of microstructures, such as micro circuit boards.

* **Prior to my time at RIT**, I contributed my skills as a **Structural & Analytics Engineer** at the Internet of Things (IoT) Tower, situated at [Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.parc.com/) (Xerox PARC). During my tenure at **Xerox PARC**, my research centered around comprehensive structural assessment for transportation infrastructures, with a special focus on bridges. I incorporated cutting-edge technologies such as fiber optic sensing, machine learning, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to enhance the safety and performance of these critical assets.

* **My academic journey** led me to pursue a **Ph.D. in Structual Engineering** at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) (UCF), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [F. Necati Catbas](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/catbas/) in the [Laboratory for Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resilience and Safety (CITRS)](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/CITRS/). My doctoral research culminated in the development of a pioneering **computer vision-based structural health monitoring and evaluation** framework. This framework effectively combined input-output information from images to assess the performance and condition of civil infrastructures. Following my Ph.D., I continued my research at UCF as a **Postdoctoral Scholar**, delving into computer vision-based multi-level structural assessment, dynamic testing, reliability evaluation, asset maintenance and management using artificial intelligence.

* As a researcher, **my interests** span a wide range of areas, including System Performance Diagnostics, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), Predictive Maintenance, Structural Health Monitoring, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, NLP, Structural Dynamics, Non-destructive Evaluation, Vibration Serviceability, FEM, Smart Sensing, Bridge Load Rating, Smart Cities, Structural Reliability, Sustainability, and Repair & Rehabilitation of Structures.

**My ultimate goal** is to leverage my expertise and experience to develop effective and efficient technologies that empower owners to make informed decisions for optimal asset management and maintenance strategies.

## Goals for the Near Future

* In the coming years, I am dedicated to exploring cutting-edge technologies to enhance critical infrastructures' safety, efficiency, and reliability, with a particular focus on optimizing asset management and maintenance strategies. 
* By delving into advanced research, I aim to drive innovations that have a profound positive impact on people's lives. My dedication lies in bridging the gap between theory and practical applications, ensuring that research findings are translated into genuinely useful products and tools. 
* Through this endeavor, I intend to support researchers and engineering practitioners in the area of industial system monitoring, condition assessment, diagnostics and prognostics, facilitating smarter decision-making and improved asset management.

## Lifetime Goals

* Looking ahead to my lifetime goals, I aspire to make a lasting impact on future generations through education and knowledge dissemination. One of my greatest ambitions is to become a professor, where I can impart valuable insights and teach courses that inspire and empower young minds. By nurturing the next generation of engineers and researchers, I hope to contribute to the growth and advancement of the field.

* Beyond academia, I also harbor a passion for creative expression and storytelling. As a personal endeavor, I aim to write a novel, using my imagination to craft compelling narratives that captivate readers and explore diverse worlds of literature.

* Furthermore, I entertain the idea of pursuing a PhD in History. This intellectual pursuit stems from my desire to understand the roots of human civilization, learn from the past, and enrich my perspective on the world's historical contexts.

* With a blend of academic, creative, and historical pursuits, I envision a future that allows me to contribute meaningfully to society, inspire others, and continuously expand my horizons of knowledge and creativity.

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Create content & metadata
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
